# MCPish
A boilerplate for using Forge's existing tools to decompile Minecraft! Alternatively you can use [MCP Reborn](https://github.com/Hexeption/MCP-Reborn) by Hexeption.

This is an outdated less-compatible method of Minecraft modding but it's useful for making quick changes! If you want to create something serious, using a Fabric or Quilt (still in beta) mod with mixins is a better idea.

## Why, toad
MCP Reborn didn't want to change their license :(.

## License
You can do what you like, basically! [Link to full text](LICENSE). **This doesn't apply to the Minecraft source code and mappings.**
